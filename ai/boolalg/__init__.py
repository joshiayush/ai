"""Symbolic Propositional Logic for Knowledge representation.

Propositional logic (PL) is the simplest form of logic where all the statements
are made by propositions. A proposition is a declarative statement which is
either true or false. It is a technique of knowledge representation in logical
and mathematical form.

##### Example

```python
from ai import (Symbol, And, Or, Not, Implication)

rain = Symbol("rain")
hagrid = Symbol("hagrid")
dumbledore = Symbol("dumbledore")

knowledge = And(
    Implication(Not(rain), hagrid),
    Or(hagrid, dumbledore),
    Not(And(hagrid, dumbledore)),
    dumbledore
)

print(model_check(knowledge, rain))
```
"""

from .logic import (
  Symbol, Not, And, Or, Implication, Biconditional, model_check
)
