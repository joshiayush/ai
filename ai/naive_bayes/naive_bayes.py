class GaussianNaiveBayes:
  """Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB).
  
  Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on
  applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional
  independence between every pair of features given the value of the class
  variable. Bayes theorem states the following relationship, given class
  variable `y` and dependent feature vector :math:`x_{1}` through :math:`x_{n}`:

  .. math::

      P(y | x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) = \\dfrac{
                                    P(y) \\cdot P(x_{1} ..., x_{n} | y)
                                  }{
                                    P(x_{1} ..., x_{n})
                                  }

  Using the naive conditional independence assumption that:

  .. math::

      P(x_{i} | y, x_{1}, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_{n}) = P(x_{i} | y)

  for all :math:`i`, this relationship is simplified to:

  .. math::

      P(y | x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) = \\dfrac{
                                    P(y) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_{i} | y)
                                  }{
                                    P(x_{1} ..., x_{n})
                                  }

  Since :math:`P(x_{1}, ..., x_{n})` is constant given the input, we can use the
  following classification rule:

  .. math::

      P(y | x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) \\propto P(y) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_{i} | y)

      ⇒ \\hat y = arg \\max_{y} P(y) \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(x_{i} | y)

  and we can use Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation to estimate :math:`P(y)`
  and :math:`P(x_{i} | y)`;  the former is then the relative frequency of class
  :math:`y` in the training set.

  `GaussianNB` implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
  The likelihood of the features is assumed to be Gaussian:

  .. math::

      P(x_{i} | y) = \\dfrac{
                        1
                      }{
                        \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma_{y}^{2}}
                      } \\exp \\left( -\\dfrac{
                                          (x_{i} - \\mu_{y})^2
                                        }{
                                          2 \\sigma_{y}^2
                                        } \\right)

  The parameters :math:`\\sigma_{y}` and :math:`\\mu_{y}` are estimated using
  maximum likelihood.
