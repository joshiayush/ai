"""An implementation of statistical operations for `ai`.

.. note::

  We don't support `numpy` arrays of more than 2 dimensions but plan to do it in
  future.

  Also, unlike `numpy` functions our implementation assumes the given dataset to
  be a sample not a population hence uses `ddof=1`.

def mean(a: np.ndarray, /, *, axis: Optional[int] = None) -> np.ndarray:
  """Compute the mean along the specified axis.

  Returns the average of the array elements. The average is taken over the
  flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.

  .. math::

    \\bar x = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}

  Args:
    a: A 2-D numpy vector.
    axis: A integer value specifying along which axis to calculate the mean.

  Returns:
    The mean for each vector.

  Raises:
    `ValueError` if `a` has more than 1 dimension.

  .. note::

    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided by the
    number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.

  ##### Example

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
  >>> a
  array([[1, 2],
         [3, 4]])
  >>> from ai import stats

  >>> stats.mean(a, axis=0)
  array([1.5, 3.5])
  >>> stats.mean(a, axis=1)

def median(a: np.ndarray, /, *, axis: Optional[int] = None) -> np.ndarray:
  """Compute the median along the specified axis.

  The median is often compared with other descriptive statistics such as the
  `mean` (average), `mode`, and `std` (standard deviation) and is robust to
  outliers.

  For odd number of numbers in a dataset the median is calculated using:

  .. math::

    M = \\dfrac{n+1}{2}; \\quad \\text{odd}

  For even number of numbers in a dataset the median is calculated using:

  .. math::

    M = \\dfrac{1}{2}(\\dfrac{n}{2} + \\dfrac{n+1}{2}); \\quad \\text{even}


  Args:
    a: A 2-D numpy vector.
    axis: A integer value specifying along which axis to calculate the mean.

  Returns:
    The median for each vector.

  .. note::

    Given a vector `V` of length `N`, the median of `V` is the middle value of a
    sorted copy of `V`, `V_sorted` - i e., `V_sorted[(N-1)/2]`, when `N` is odd,
    and the average of the two middle values of `V_sorted` when `N` is even.

  """Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.

  Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a distribution, of
  the array elements. The standard deviation is computed for the flattened array
  by default, otherwise over the specified axis.

  .. math::

    s = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \\bar x)^{2}}{n - 1}}

  Args:
    a: Calculate the standard deviation of these values.
    ddof: Means Delta Degrees of Freedom. The divisor used in calculations is
      `N - ddof`, where `N` represents the number of elements. By default `ddof`

      compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.

  Returns:

    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the `mean`, i.e., `std = sqrt(mean(x))`, where
    `x = abs(a - a.mean())**2`.

    The average squared deviation is typically calculated as `x.sum() / N`,
    where `N = len(x)`. If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor `N - ddof`
    is used instead. In standard statistical practice, `ddof=1` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite population. `ddof=0`
    provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for normally
    distributed variables. The standard deviation computed in this function is
    the square root of the estimated variance, so even with `ddof=1`, it will
    not be an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.
