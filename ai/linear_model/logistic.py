    Hypothesis function for our `LogisticRegression` is the same as for the
    `LinearRegression` :math:`\\hat y = b + wX`, where `b` is the model's
    intercept and `w` is the coefficient of `X`.

    The cost function or the loss function that we use is the Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) between the predicted value and the true value. The cost function
    `(J)` can be written as:

    .. math::

      J = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\hat y_{i} - y_{i})^2

    To achieve the best-fit regression line, the model aims to predict the
    target value :math:`\\hat Y` such that the error difference between the
    predicted value :math:`\\hat Y` and the true value :math:`Y` is minimum. So,
    it is very important to update the `b` and `w` values, to reach the best
    value that minimizes the error between the predicted `y` value and the true
    `y` value.

    A logistic regression model can be trained using the optimization algorithm
    gradient descent by iteratively modifying the model’s parameters to reduce
    the mean squared error (MSE) of the model on a training dataset. To update
    `b` and `w` values in order to reduce the Cost function (minimizing RMSE
    value) and achieve the best-fit line the model uses Gradient Descent. The
    idea is to start with random `b` and `w` values and then iteratively update
    the values, reaching minimum cost.

    On differentiating cost function `J` with respect to `b`:

    .. math::

      \\dfrac{dJ}{db} = \\dfrac{2}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(
                        \\hat y_{i} - y_{i}
                        )

    On differentiating cost function `J` with respect to `w`:

    .. math::

      \\dfrac{dJ}{dw} = \\dfrac{2}{n} \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(
                        \\hat y_{i} - y_{i}
                        ) \\cdot x_{i}

    The above derivative functions are used for updating `weights` and `bias` in
    each iteration.

    The sigmoid function is then used for mapping the predictions between 0 and
    1.

    .. math::

      \\sigma (z) = \\dfrac{1}{1 - e^{-z}}

    where :math:`z` can be replaced with our hypothesis function
    :math:`\\hat y = b + wX`.
