  """Implements Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF).

  The Gaussian RBF is a commonly used kernel function in Support Vector Machines
  and other machine learning algorithms. It's defined as:

  .. math::

    K(x, x') = e^{-\\dfrac{||x - x'||^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}

  Here's the derivation:

  * The Gaussian RBF is defined as a function of two data points, :math:`x` and
  :math:`x'`, with a parameter :math:`\\sigma` that controls the width of the
  kernel.
  * We start by computing the euclidean distance between the two data points
  :math:`x` and :math:`x'`:

  .. math::

    ||x - x'||^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - x'_{i})^2

  Now, let's insert this distance into the Gaussian RBF formula:

  .. math::

    K(x, x') = e^{-\\dfrac{||x - x'||^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}}

  We have an exponential term, and we can simplify it further:

  .. math::

    e^{-\\dfrac{||x - x'||^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}} = e^{
      -\\dfrac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - x'_{i})^2
    }

  We can further generalize it using the property
  :math:`e^{a + b}` = :math:`e^a * e ^b`, we can separate the exponential
  factors:

  .. math::

    K(x, x') = e^{
      -\\dfrac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - x'_{i})^2
    } = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}e^{-\\dfrac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}(x - x')^{2}}

  This is the mathematical implementation of the Gaussian RBF. It measures the
  similarity between two data points :math:`x` and :math:`x'` based on the
  Euclidean distance between them, with the parameter :math:`\\sigma`
  controlling the width of the kernel.

  Args:
    x: The numpy vector :math:`x`.
    x_prime: The numpy vector :math:`x'`.
    sigma: The paramter :math:`\\sigma` to control the width of the kernel.

  Returns:
    RBF value.

  Examples:

  >>> # Example data points
  >>> x1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
  >>> x2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
  ...
  >>> # Set the width parameter
  >>> sigma = 1.0
  ...
  >>> # Calculate the RBF value
  >>> rbf_result = grbf(x1, x2, sigma)
  >>> print("Gaussian RBF Value:", rbf_result)
  """
  sqr_dist = np.sum(np.power((x - x_prime), 2))
  grbf_val = np.exp(-sqr_dist / (2 * sigma**2))
  return grbf_val
