  """Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights.

  Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
  If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`, then
  the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i`
  and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i`.

  Args:
    m:        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
              Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
              observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y:        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same
              form as that of `m`.
    rowvar:   If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
              variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise,
              relationship is transposed: each column represents a variable,
              while the rows contains observations.
    bias:     Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is
              the number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is
              True, then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be
              overriden by using the keyword ``ddof``.
    ddof:     If not ``None`` then the default value implied by `bias` is
              overridden. Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased
              estimate, even if both `fweights` and `aweights` are specified,
              and ``ddof=0`` will return the simple average.
    fweights: 1-D array of integer frequency weight; the number of times each
              observation vector should be repeated.
    aweights: 1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights
              are typically large for observations considered "important" and
              smaller for observations considered less "important". If
              ``ddof=0`` the array of weights can be used to assign
              probabilities to observation vectors.
    dtype:    Data type of the result. By default the return data type will
              have at least `numpy.float64` precision.

    Returns:
      The covariance matrix of the variables.

    Notes:
      Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation array
      `m` and let ``f=fweights`` and ``a=aweights`` for brevity. The steps to
      compute the weighted covariance are as follows:

          >>> m = np.arange(10, dtype=np.float64)
          >>> f = np.arange(10) * 2
          >>> a = np.arange(10) ** 2
          >>> ddof = 1
          >>> w = f * a
          >>> v1 = np.sum(w)
          >>> v2 = np.sum(w * a)
          >>> m -= np.sum(m * w, axis=None, keepdims=True) / v1
          >>> cov = np.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / ((v1 ** 2) - (ddof * v2))

      Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
      ``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (np.sum(f) - ddof)`` as it
      should.
