    "In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), the __Pearson correlation coefficient__  ― also known as __Pearson's r__, the __Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC)__, the __bivariate correlation__, or colloquially simply as the __correlation coefficient__ ― is the measure of linear correlation between two sets of data."

    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation coefficient is the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The form of the definition involves a \"product moment\", that is, the mean of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name."
